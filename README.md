Basic, beginner-level tests of knowledge

Hi Mato Grosso, or Thick Grass, if I may.

Welcome to my incipient GitHub. I have close to zero knowledge on how any of this works. All I know is that a readme file is a must for an organized project.
I have no project, however. I've just written this so far. And to be honest, not even this can I do without minor hiccups. For example, there is no automatic
tabulation, meaning I have to hit 'enter' each time I want to go to the next line. Primordial, right? OK, just head for the actual file since there's no more 
to be said here.

Goodbye. I hope you enjoy what I've coded. It took me many hours just to accomplish those measly 100 lines.
